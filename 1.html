  <h2>DEMENTIA에 대해 알아보자</h2>
  <a href="https://www.alz.org/alzheimers-dementia/what-is-dementia" target="_blank" title="What is Dementia">Dementia</a> is a general term for <strong>loss of <u>memory</u>, language, problem-solving and other thinking abilities</strong> that are severe enough to interfere with daily life.
  Alzheimer's disease accounts for 60-80% of cases. Vascular dementia, which occurs because of microscopic bleeding and blood vessel blockage in the brain, is the second most common cause of dementia.<img src="dementia.jpg" width="100%"><p>Those who experience the brain changes of multiple types of dementia simultaneously have mixed dementia. There are many other conditions that can cause symptoms of dementia, including some that are reversible, such as thyroid problems and vitamin deficiencies.</p>
